# Project Learn IT, Girl - 3rd Edition
This project was developed by me, with my mentor orientation, for the program Learn IT, Girl - 3rd Edition.

The objective of this project is to bring interest from girls and boys who are interested in learning more
about network, cybersecurity, and also learn a new programming language - in this case, Python.

The tools to developed this project was:
1. Python - Programming Language
2. Scapy - Python Library
3. WireShark - open source tool to record ana analyze network traffic
4. GitHub

This project was developed for a education purpose, and it is a modification of other source codes,
in order to facilitate the learning for its users. The codes presented on my project Learn IT, Girl
were modifed to adapt for the project's needs. The source codes are:
1. https://github.com/AllGloryToTheHypnotoad/Black-Hat-Python/blob/master/BHP-Code/Chapter4/pic_carver.py
2. http://bt3gl.github.io/black-hat-python-infinite-possibilities-with-the-scapy-module.html

I would like to say thank you to my mentor, Karla Saur, and all the Learn IT, Girl team for the support,
and for bringing this program for me and for many other girls.
